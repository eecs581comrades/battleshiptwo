Needs Implemented:
-Scattershot: Choose center of 3x3 area for 3 random spots to fire at
-Sonar: Shows opponents nearby ships

Debug:
-Medium AI Chase has two possible cases to sort out: Ships next to each other and out of range
^He hasn't merged MediumAI to the main branch yet

Now a Features (Don't fix):
-If player tries to hit same spot twice it doesn't stop them, it allows next player's turn
^the special shots rely on this "feature"... should've paid attention to where you already shot, this is war!
